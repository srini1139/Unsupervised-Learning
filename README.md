# Unsupervised-Learning
This repository consists of SVM model and PCA
 Exploratory Data Analysis
 Reduce number dimensions in the dataset with minimal information loss
 Train a model using Principle Components
Objective:
Apply dimensionality reduction technique – PCA and train a model using principle components instead of training the model using just the raw data.
